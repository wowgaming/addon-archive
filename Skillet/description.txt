[B]Skillet[/B]: A trade skill window replacement

Skillet is a replacement for the default tradeskill and craft UI, and is based on [URL=http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info5812-AdvancedTradeSkillWindow]ATSW[/URL] , by Slarti. This is not a continuation of ATSW, which is still going strong as far as I know, but is rather a brand new mod based in the ideas in ATSW.

[I]Skillet is now hosted by wowace.com and is available through the various updators that reference that site.[/I]

[B]Features[/B]
[list]
[*]Larger the the standard tradeskill window
[*]Built-in queue for creating multiple, different items
[*]User editable list of notes attached to reagents and crafted items.
[*]Automatically buy reagents for queued recipes when visiting a vendor
[*]Recipes can be filtered by name, whether or not you could level when creating the item, and whether or not you have the mats available.
[*]If you can craft a reagent needed by a recipe, then clicking on that reagent will take you to its recipe (same features as [I]Reverse Engineering[/I].
[*]Queued items are saved when you log out and are restored on log in
[*]If the item to be crafted requires a minimum level to use, that level can be displayed along with the recipe (disabled by default)
[*]The shopping list of items needed for all queued recipes for all alts can be displayed at banks, auction houses, or from the command line
[*]Items needed for crafting queued items can be automatically retrieved from your bank (by using the shopping list)
[*]Sorting of recipes (name, difficulty, level, and quality of crafted item)
[*]Complete or mostly complete localizations for deDE, koKR, zhCN, zhTW, and frFR.
[*]Complete support for Alternate characters (trade skills, queued recipes, reagent stocks)
[/list]

[B]Planned (Future) Features[/B]
[list]
[*]Sorting by slot (head/arms/leg etc)
[*]Custom filtering of recipes (have mats, have mats in bank, min level/max level, etc)
[*]"Craft Until .." where Skillet will continue to make items until you run out of reagents or a certain skill level is met or until the recipe becomes grey/green.
[*]Queue heirarchies so that deleting a item that queued up craftable reagents will also remove those queue entries
[/list]

[B]Supported / Tested Mods[/B]

Skillet has been tested with the following mods. Other mods that change or update the tradeskill window may not work.

[INDENT][I]Mod authors: please contact me if you would like to make your mod work with Skillet, or you would like me to make Skillet work with you mods. I'm always happy to discuss changing the code so it is easier to integrate with.[/I][/INDENT]

[B]Reporting Bugs or Feature Requests[/B]

I am using the [URL=http://jira.wowace.com/browse/SKL]wowace.com Jira[/URL] bug tracking system to record all bugs and features for Skillet. You can check there to see if the problem you are seeing or the feature you are interested in has been discussed before. The full list of know problems and pending feature requests is available [URL=http://jira.wowace.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&pid=10050&status=1]from that site[/URL].

[I]Jira requires an account to create new issues so if you want to report a problem, but don't want to create an account, please post a message here or email me and I will enter the bug report.[/I]

When in doubt, contact me anyway. I'd rather hear about a problem twice than not at all.

I'm often available on the #wowace IRC channel ([URL=irc://irc.freenode.org/wowace]irc://irc.freenode.org/wowace[/URL]) if you'd like to chat with me.
